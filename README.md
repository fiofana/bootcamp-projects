## 🌱 Background 

As a **Biotechnology and Bioprocesses Engineering student**, I discovered the transformative power of programming during my first semester. While initially exploring web development through the **GB Desenvolve 2021 FullStack Bootcamp** (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), I realized my true passion in leveraging data to drive decisions for a better world.  

My academic research work in bioinformatics revealed a critical gap: *massive biological datasets often go underutilized due to a lack of analytical frameworks*. This inspired me to pivot toward **data science**, where I completed the **WoMakersCode Data Analytics Bootcamp 2024.2**, honing skills in Data Analysis and Visualization, Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modeling. 

Collaborating with a squad on the course projects deepened my ability to translate technical insights into actionable strategies. I believe my Biotechnological and Data oriented knowledge allows me to:  
1. Bridge technical and non-technical teams in interdisciplinary environments.  
2. Design models that account for real-world biological constraints.  
3. Identify high-impact opportunities where data can accelerate innovation.

Now, I’m expanding into **Machine Learning** to build scalable solutions for sustainability challenges in biotech.  

**Next Goal:** Developing ML models to optimize renewable energy systems and reduce waste in bioprocessing. 💡
